# comparisons

This is a demonstration program created for my masters thesis. It is written in Java 8 using Maven. 
The goal was to compute runtime or elementary steps taken for different algorithms.
Bubble, insertion, selection and quick sort, matrix multiplication with Friedvalds algorithm, and a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented.
The program can be built using the maven command line utility or using an IDE that supports maven build files.
To build the program using the command line utility run the mvn package command with the work directory set to the folder containing the source files for the program. Once the build finishes the compiled application can be found in the target folder and can be run using the command java -jar comparisons-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
