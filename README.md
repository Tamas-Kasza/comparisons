# comparisons

This is a demonstration program created for my masters thesis. It is written in Java 8 using Maven. 
The goal was to compute runtime or elementary steps taken for different algorithms.
Bubble, insertion, selection and quick sort, matrix multiplication with Friedvalds algorithm, and a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented.
